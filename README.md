### Usage

In order to automatically build your Ibis PDF files, create a directory called `.github/workflows/` and add a fill called `ibis.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Ibis eBook Generation
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main
      with:
        fetch-depth: '0'
    - name: Build Ibis Export Files
      uses: bobbyiliev/ibis-build-action@main
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        IBIS_PATH: './'
        IBIS_BRANCH: 'main'
        EMAIL: 'bobby@bobbyiliev.com'
        COMMIT_MESSAGE: 'Updated Ibis Exorted Files'
```

## Environment Variables

* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Required for permission to tag the repo. You can leave it as it is.
* `IBIS_PATH`: The path to the Ibis init folder. By default it is `./` but if you have a custom location, make sure to update it
* `IBIS_BRANCH`: The Branch that the Ibis exported files will be commited and pushed to. Default is `main`.
* `EMAIL`: The email address that the commit will be associated with.
* `COMMIT_MESSAGE`: The commit message.

## Workflow

* Commit some changes
* Either push to `main` or open a PR
* On push (or merge), the action will:
    * Clone the repository
    * Run the `ibis build` commands including the sample builds
    * Stage and commit the new exported eBook files to the specified branch
    * Pushes tag to GitHub
